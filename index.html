							Green Space and Park accessibility in the Island of Montreal.
							<br><br>Urban green areas are very a very important part of a city, they provide ecosystem services such as temperature regulation, air filtration and as an area we can all use to enjoy!

							This project will follow the 'Reseacher' adventure path, it will look at green space and park accessibility in the Island of Montreal. 
							<br><br>
							Project objectives:<br><br>
							1) Look at the green area difference between lower and higher income boroughs based on income and land use data. we will be able to analyze which boroughs benefit the least from green spaces and the ecosystem services they provide and see if income influences these results.<br><br>
							2) Based on objective #1, this project will look at the areas with the lowest accessibility to green spaces and/or parks. Based on this, with a series of parameters we can continue to analyze and create visualizations.<br><br>
							3) We will be able to select areas that could benefit from greenery using results from objective #2 and tools such as delimiters and buffers, using parameters such as proximity to schools, low accessibility, and population density data to help us find potential locations for parks or green spaces. (If this is possible through python and Jupyter notebook). <br><br>
							4)Create visualizations such as maps and graphs that will allow us to better understand the results.

							<b>This project will take you through a series of steps, like we have done for the Jupyter labs, and will show visualizations such as graphs, maps and data analysis along the way.
							<br><br>
							<b>DATA:</b> the data needed for this project is income data of boroughs, population density of boroughs, land use data. All the data will be for the Island of Montreal.
